O(n log n)  // Best Case: Occurs when the partitioning is balanced, and each recursive call processes half of the elements.
O(n log n)  // Average Case: Average time complexity when the partitioning is reasonably balanced.
O(n^2)      // Worst Case: Occurs when the partitioning is unbalanced, and the pivot always picks the smallest or largest element.
