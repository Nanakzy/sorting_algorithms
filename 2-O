O(n^2)  // Best Case: The best case occurs when the array is already sorted, but the algorithm still needs to check every pair of elements.
O(n^2)  // Average Case: The average case also requires nested loops to compare and swap elements.
O(n^2)  // Worst Case: The worst case occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order, leading to maximum comparisons and swaps.
